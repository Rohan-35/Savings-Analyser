# Savings-Analyser
This is my very own savings analyser program. This was my attempt to create a simple ML model which could learn from keywords of expense category and don't need to write entire name of the category everytime.
This model will accept expense keywords and value, classify it in particular category and save it in an online DB (in our case, Google Sheets). Later on, this sheets file will be used to generate an automated Dashboard in Google Data studio which will help us understand various trends and our spending habbits.
